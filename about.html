            <p>I have been interested in web development since I got Adobe Dreamweaver and Photoshop installed on my computer at the age of ten, 15 years ago. 
            </p> 
            <p>One of the most noticeable changes that I have come across is how developers approach layout design. Initially frames were predominantly used. However, eventually the limitations became obvious and tables became developers first choice. As this wasn't what tables was made for, CSS-techniques with floats and positioning became a more appropriate approach.
            </p>
            <p>I'm excited about learning the newest CSS3-techniques like Flexbox and Columns for layouts in the future. I haven't used it on this site as it doesn't have full browser support yet.</p>

            <p>
                I studied web development both in High School as well as in University. However, I had to take a break from my studies when my career as a professional poker player took off, where I have a world series of poker title to show for my efforts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, I have kept myself constantly up to date with news in web development. I have also helped family and friends with different web projects and taken various online courses in web development during this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I now see myself returning to a path in web development as a professional in order to further utilize my creative ideas and proven ability to think in new ways.
